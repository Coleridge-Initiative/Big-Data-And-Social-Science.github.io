	explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe
	an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform.
	This setting is useful in applications (such as the task of driving)
	where it may be difficult to write down an explicit reward function
	specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off.
	We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that
	is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give
	an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our
	algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try
	to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm
	terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though
	we may never recover the expert's reward function, the policy output
	by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert,
	where here performance is measured with respect to the expert's unknown
	reward function.}},

  title = {Open Information Extraction from the Web},
  booktitle = ijcai,
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying
	precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora
	(e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements).
	Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations
	and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training
	examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target
	relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction
	paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its
	corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring
	any human input. The paper also introduces TextRunner, a fully implemented,
	highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability
	and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user
	queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus
	that compare TextRunner with KnowItAll, a state-of-the-art Web IE
	system. TextRunner achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a comparable
	set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KnowItAll
	to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TextRunner
	extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude
	more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TextRunner's
	11,000,000 highest probability tuples and show that they contain
	over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},

	uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and

	in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks.
	It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for

	Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key

	the underlying distribution. Compared with the usual visualization,
	which simply lists the most probable topical terms, the multi-word
	expressions provide a better intuitive impression for what a topic
	is "about." Our approach is based on a language model of arbitrary
	length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based
	on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show

	which are identified by bilinguals as somehow being 'the same thing'.
	Cognates have at least 4 essential properties: 1) they are always
	structural units; 2) they are words; 3) words paired may be but need
	not be semantically identical; 4) there is always some kind of formal
	resemblance between cognates. I argue that these properties can be
	explained in terms of a particular model of lexical activation and
	word recognition, namely the Cohort Model. I also take up the question
	of defining cognates for psycho linguistic purposes and argue against
	using traditional extensional definitions based on etymology and
	genetic relatedness. I argue for defining cognates in terms of their
	structural representations and the processes which activate and select
	them.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in its interface,
	and how do we decide how the interface represents information about
	the world and about its own workings to a user? This article addresses
	these questions by examining the interaction between representation
	and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers
	at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system
	is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys
	its representations of information and the world to human users,
	and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human
	user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds
	of representation (of the system, information and the world, the
	interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of
	intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent
	systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a
	human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and
	for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways
	on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing
	issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational
	agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person,
	information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such
	as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality
	independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.}

	skills they ?grew up with.? This article examines this explanation
	and related claims through evidence from a study of 28 graduate students
	and their advisors in four disciplines at eight U.S. research universities.
	Although all the doctoral students used electronic communication
	technologies in various ways, their work practices reinforced existing
	patterns of work and resource use in their disciplines. Students
	used electronic communication to (1) mimic the electronic communication
	patterns of their advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their
	research with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3)
	enhance the social connections and material resources their advisor
	or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or improve ?hands-on?
	research techniques (textual analysis, wet lab work, programming,

	disentangle syntactic from lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing.
	Our findings strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44,
	pars opercularis) is critically implicated in processing syntactic
	information, whereas the lower portion of the left inferior frontal
	gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is selectively involved in processing

	Unfortunately, in many applications, the "in-domain" test data is
	drawn from a distribution that is related, but not identical, to
	the "out-of-domain" distribution of the training data. We consider
	the common case in which labeled out-of-domain data is plentiful,
	but labeled in-domain data is scarce. We introduce a statistical
	formulation of this problem in terms of a simple mixture model and
	present an instantiation of this framework to maximum entropy classifiers
	and their linear chain counterparts. We present efficient inference
	algorithms for this special case based on the technique of conditional
	expectation maximization. Our experimental results show that our
	approach leads to improved performance on three real world tasks
	on four different data sets from the natural language processing

  abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate
	knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations
	to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically,
	the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form
	of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from
	recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which
	employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm.
	We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the
	proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning
	rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as
	the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give
	several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems
	with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints.
	We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive
	subgradient methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet
	non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

  abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring
	population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly,
	we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model
	accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed
	populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification
	has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events
	farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin
	of chromosomal regions and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical
	uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use
	for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model
	for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification
	of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using
	the existing method. We present results applying the new methods
	to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter
	pylori and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods
	are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available
	at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

	users {(SUs)}, i.e. models that simulate the behavior of real users,
	and use reinforcement learning {(RL).} The {SUs} are trained on a
	spoken dialogue corpus in a negotiation domain, and then tweaked
	towards a particular cultural norm using hand-crafted rules. We evaluate
	the learned policies in a simulation setting. Our results are consistent
	with our {SUs}, in other words, the policies learn what they are
	designed to learn, which shows that {RL} is a promising technique
	for learning policies in domains, such as argumentation, that are
	more complex than standard slot-filling applications.}

  month = {January},
  abstract = {{"Why did crime in New York drop so suddenly in the mid-90s? How does
	an unknown novelist end up a bestselling author? Why is teenage smoking
	out of control, when everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV
	shows like Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why
	did Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this brilliant
	and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks
	at why major changes in our society so often happen suddenly and
	unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues,
	often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single
	sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters
	and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer
	fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics,
	and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical
	mass, is the Tipping Point. <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces
	us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators
	of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of
	word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television,
	direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues
	about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a
	successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen
	to show how to start and sustain social epidemics. The Tipping Point
	is an intellectual adventure story written with an infectious enthusiasm
	for the power and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map
	to change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one imaginative
	person applying a well-placed lever can move the world."}},

  author = {Peter D. Gr\"{u}nwald},
  volume = {1},
  series = {MIT Press Books},
  abstract = {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a powerful method
	of inductive inference, the basis of statistical modeling, pattern
	recognition, and machine learning. It holds that the best explanation,
	given a limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the
	greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are particularly well-suited
	for dealing with model selection, prediction, and estimation problems
	in situations where the models under consideration can be arbitrarily
	complex, and overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive,
	step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a comprehensive
	reference (with an emphasis on conceptual issues) that is accessible
	to graduate students and researchers in statistics, pattern classification,
	machine learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in
	the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other applied
	sciences that involve model selection, including biology, econometrics,
	and experimental psychology. Part I provides a basic introduction
	to MDL and an overview of the concepts in statistics and information
	theory needed to understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding,
	the information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and part
	III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory of inductive
	inference based on universal coding. Part IV provides a comprehensive
	overview of the statistical theory of exponential families with an
	emphasis on their information-theoretic properties. The text includes
	a number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a \&quot;fast
	track\&quot; through the material, and boxes highlighting the most
	important concepts.},

	(1967) to the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows
	the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated at each
	point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at successive points
	gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word
	information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic
	grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per
	word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive

	have significantly higher citation impact than non-OA articles. There
	are two roads to OA: the ?golden? road (publish your article in an

	journal but also self-archive it in an OA archive). About 10\% of
	journals are gold, but over 90\% are already green (i.e., they have
	given their authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about
	10?20\% of articles have been self-archived. To reach 100\% OA, self-archiving

	no use of the available information. The incremental process constructs
	policies which includes more of the information available to the
	decision maker at each step. While the process converges to the optimal
	policy, our approach is designed for situations in which computing
	the optimal policy is infeasible. We provide examples of the process
	on several large decision problems, showing that, for these examples,
	the process constructs valuable (but sub-optimal) policies before
	the optimal policy would be available by traditional methods. 1}},

  comment = {When costs of computation are not taken into account, optimal policies
	can be determined using dynamic programming [Howard and Matheson,
	1984; Shachter, 1986]. When the costs of computation are not negligible,
	the cost of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming
	may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which can be used
	to compute policies for large multi-stage decision problems under
	uncertainty represented as influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental,
	and uses abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing
	a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and Matheson,
	1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs, preferences, and available
	actions from the perspective of a single decision maker. A decision
	tree represents a decision function. The single stage information
	refinement algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence diagram
	with a single decision node. A policy is represented by a collection
	of decision trees, one for each decision node in the influence diagram.
	A deterministic decision tree is an inappropriate representation
	for a decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being refined.
	For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement may have ramifications
	for the global policy. Neither of these complications occur for single-stage
	problems.},

	analyses revealed that the level of integrative sequencing was more
	a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring negotiator

	In this paper we present a generative model called JointLDA which
	uses a bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an unaligned
	corpus. Experiments conducted on different data sets confirm our
	conjecture that jointly modeling the cross-lingual corpora offers
	several advantages compared to individual monolingual models. Since
	the JointLDA model merges related topics in different languages into
	a single multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively
	fewer topics. b) it has the ability to predict related words from
	a language different than that of the given document. In fact it
	has better predictive power compared to the bag-of-word based translation
	model leaving the possibility for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word
	model for cross-lingual IR applications. We also found that the monolingual
	models learnt while optimizing the cross-lingual copora are more
	effective than the corresponding LDA models. },

  journal = {Cognitive Science},

  pages = {137--194},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {{The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure from some
	mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing among these structures
	to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input--are fundamental to
	language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological
	results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access,
	parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing
	of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to
	combine models which account for these results to build a general,
	uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic,
	and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical
	access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access
	have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic
	data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which
	models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge.
	The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions
	for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional
	probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned
	through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for
	the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic
	treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results,
	arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge
	and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters
	as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.}},

	The decision-making module chooses from allowable actions in the

	the estimated probability of answering correctly is a function of
	past performance and confidence in correctly answering the current
	question. When given a six question head start (i.e., when starting
	from the \$2,000 level), we find that the system performs about as
	well on average as humans starting at the beginning. Our system demonstrates

  abstract = {{Most techniques for relating textual information rely on intellectually
	created links such as author-chosen keywords and titles, authority
	indexing terms, or bibliographic citations. Similarity of the semantic
	content of whole documents, rather than just titles, abstracts, or
	overlap of keywords, offers an attractive alternative. Latent semantic
	analysis provides an effective dimension reduction method for the
	purpose that reflects synonymy and the sense of arbitrary word combinations.
	However, latent semantic analysis correlations with human text-to-text
	similarity judgments are often empirically highest at ≈300 dimensions.
	Thus, two- or three-dimensional visualizations are severely limited
	in what they can show, and the first and/or second automatically
	discovered principal component, or any three such for that matter,
	rarely capture all of the relations that might be of interest. It
	is our conjecture that linguistic meaning is intrinsically and irreducibly
	very high dimensional. Thus, some method to explore a high dimensional
	similarity space is needed. But the 2.7 × 107 projections and infinite
	rotations of, for example, a 300-dimensional pattern are impossible
	to examine. We suggest, however, that the use of a high dimensional
	dynamic viewer with an effective projection pursuit routine and user
	control, coupled with the exquisite abilities of the human visual
	system to extract information about objects and from moving patterns,
	can often succeed in discovering multiple revealing views that are
	missed by current computational algorithms. We show some examples
	of the use of latent semantic analysis to support such visualizations
	and offer views on future needs.}},

  abstract = {The standard interpretation of the logical operators in a Boolean
	retrieval system is in general too strict. A standard Boolean query
	rarely comes close to retrieving all and only those documents which
	are relevant to the user. An AND query is often too narrow and an
	OR query is often too broad. The choice of the AND results in retrieving
	on the left end of a typical average recall-precision graph, while
	the choice of the OR results in retrieving on the right end, implying
	a tradeoff between precision and recall. This study basically examines
	various proposed schemes, the P-norm, Classical Fuzzy-Set, MMM, Paice

	logical operators, and thus to attain both high precision and high
	recall search performance. Each of the above schemes has shown great
	improvement over the standard Boolean scheme in terms of retrieval
	effectiveness. The differences in retrieval effectiveness between
	P-norm, Paice and MMM are shown to be relatively small. However,

  abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an
	issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods
	for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt
	spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these
	approaches are less well suited to the identification of content
	that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order
	of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We
	develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that
	travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable
	algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify
	a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation
	on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such
	a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of
	the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long
	been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been
	captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis.
	We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period
	of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find
	a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle.
	In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the
	peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively,
	with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like
	pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and
	analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation
	that the system exhibits.},

	The mechanics of CRFs and their relationship to maximum entropy are

	form of gene and biological term lexicons to achieve a precision
	of 86.4 and recall of 78.7\%. An analysis of the contribution of
	the various features of the model is provided.},

	two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion,
	called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information
	lost and gained in changing from clustering \${\cal C}\$ to clustering
	\${\cal C}'\$. The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings
	were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The
	basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point
	of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive,
	symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough,
	it is a true metric on the space of clusterings. Keywords: Clustering;
	Comparing partitions; Measures of agreement; Information theory;

	of the development paradigm (recipe) of the Washington consensus
	based on the pillars of liberalization, privatization and deregulation,
	new and challenging thinking and analysis need to be brought to bear
	on the problems faced by developing countries. While sound macro
	policies and low inflation are undoubtedly important precursors to
	self sustainable growth, they are not in themselves sufficient to
	deliver development. We argue that if development is a matter of
	self transformation arising from within an economy, then innovation
	must play a central role in the process and so to must the capacity
	for an economy to develop, integrate and adapt to novelty. This is
	at the core of the concept of self sustaining development and indeed
	why development is an emergent phenomenon. Thus the key questions
	for policy makers are: How can a transformation of innovation performance
	be achieved in a competitive international economy? What are the
	appropriate policy instruments? What role is there for universities?
	What stimuli can be given to entrepreneurial action? We explore these
	in terms of a critical evaluation of the idea of innovation systems
	and of the nature of innovation policy appropriate to innovation
	based development. },

  abstract = {Definitions of common nouns typically give a superordinate term plus
	distinguishing features; that information provides the basis for
	organizing noun files in WordNet. The superordinate relation (hyponymy)
	generates a hierarchical semantic organization that is duplicated
	in the noun files by the use of labeled pointers between sets of
	synonyms (synsets). The hierarchy is limited in depth, seldom exceeding
	more than a dozen levels. Distinguishing features are entered in
	such a way as to create a lexical inheritance system, a system in
	which each word inherits the distinguishing features of all its superordinates.
	Three types of distinguishing features are discussed: attributes
	(modification), parts (meronymy) and functions (predication), but
	only meronymy is presently implemented in the noun files. Antonymy
	is also found between nouns, but it is not a fundamental organizing
	principle for nouns. Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical
	files, each of which deals with a different primitive semantic component.
	Characteristics of each topic are discussed.},

	of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is
	obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded

  month = {December},
  abstract = {Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by
	extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents.
	When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable
	for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document
	retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy
	text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics
	can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome
	this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic
	models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over
	words that reflect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen
	datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and
	interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the
	collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more
	useful across a broader range of text data.}

	for dependency parsing in a narrow sense, i.e. systems where the
	analysis assigned to an input sentence takes the form of a dependency
	structure. This means that we will not discuss systems that exploit
	dependency relations for the construction of another type of representation,
	such as the head-driven parsing models of Collins (1997, 1999). Moreover,
	we will restrict ourselves to systems for full parsing, which means
	that we will not deal with systems that produce a partial or underspecified

	parsers (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995).},

	the relationship between two distinct subfactors of spatial ability
	and performance in an information search task modeled on browsing
	the Web. Background: Previous studies have found relationships between
	various measures of spatial ability and performance in a wide variety
	of computerbased tasks. Method: In the search task 101 participants
	(18-29 years of age) searched for the answer to a question by navigating
	the system. They completed the experimental task as well as a battery
	of cognitive ability measures that included two different measures
	of spatial ability. Results: The results indicate that spatial orientation
	ability was related to performance with tasks that were high in their
	navigational requirement (engendered by the use of a novel aid),
	whereas spatial visualization was unrelated to performance in any
	task condition. Conclusion: A closer inspection of the cognitive
	requirements of a task may reveal what interventions could be most
	useful when designing computer systems or developing training programs.
	Application: Given the unique differences between the different spatial
	abilities, the current results suggest the design of navigational
	aids that place less demand on spatial orientation ability. Date

  abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always
	been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability
	and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites
	and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people
	can and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and
	understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity
	in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals
	with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity
	in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response
	to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions
	as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis covers
	techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented
	information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods that seek to
	address the new challenges raised by available resources, benchmark
	datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining
	and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of
	this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest
	to anyone with sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those
	that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis.
	The survey includes an enumeration of the various applications, a
	look at general challenges and discusses categorization, extraction
	and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just the technical issues,
	devoting significant attention to the broader implications that the
	development of opinion-oriented information-access services have:
	questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation and whether or
	not reviews can have measurable economic impact. To facilitate future
	work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and
	evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment
	Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and

  abstract = {The two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, denoted $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha,
	\theta)$ is a probability distribution on the set of decreasing positive
	sequences with sum 1. The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with
	a single parameter $\theta$, introduced by Kingman, is $\mathsf{PD}(0,
	\theta)$. Known properties of $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$, including
	the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov,
	are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random
	permutation of $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a simple residual
	allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity
	and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions
	of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For $0 < \alpha < 1, \mathsf{PD}(\alpha,
	0)$ is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions
	of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution
	is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha$.
	Formulae in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and
	Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked lengths
	of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2,
	0)$ and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bredge is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2,
	1/2)$. The $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ and $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \alpha)$
	distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of the ranked
	lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov process whose zero set
	is the range of a stable subordinator of index $\alpha$.},

	models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and
	gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory
	along with a description of selected applications of the theory to
	distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of
	original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring
	the background required to pursue further this area of research.
	The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and
	shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is
	a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The
	theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing
	and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems
	of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these
	problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied,
	including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

	experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate

	A new values instrument, based on the theory and suitable for cross-cultural
	research, is described. Evidence relevant for assessing the theory,
	from 97 samples in 44 countries, is summarized. Relations of this
	approach to Rokeach's work on values and to other theories and research
	on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to

	can achieve greater accuracy with fewer labeled training instances
	if it is allowed to choose the training data from which is learns.
	An active learner may ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances
	to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning
	is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where
	unlabeled data may be abundant but labels are difficult, time-consuming,
	or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction
	to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes
	a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated,
	and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the
	literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical
	evidence for active learning, a summary of several problem setting
	variants, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning
	research are also presented.}},

  abstract = {{Using a sentiment score provided by Thomson Reuters to measure the
	tone of news articles, this paper examines monthly portfolio returns
	constructed from information about past news articles. The sentiment
	score is obtained from the kind of words and phrases that are used
	in the news article. Positive tone in news articles in the past months
	predicts positive returns. Similarly, negative tone in the past months
	predicts negative returns. Past sentiment predicts future returns
	even for large stocks. The predictive ability of past sentiment dominates
	the predictive ability of past returns. After controlling for past
	sentiment, the predictive ability of past returns (in predicting
	future return) disappears. The findings are robust to multiple specifications.
	The predictive ability of past sentiment can be used profitably.
	When applied to the largest decile of stocks, a strategy that takes
	a long position in stocks with past positive sentiment score and
	a short position in stocks with past negative sentiment score generates
	a statistically significant alpha of 34 basis points per month. The
	resulting portfolio is also positively correlated with a long-short
	momentum portfolio. Within the same time period, a trading strategy
	using the sentiment scores from the subset of news articles citing
	analysts is not profitable. The news items that cite analysts have
	economically significant contemporaneous returns. The findings suggest
	that (i) the market underreacts to information contained in news
	articles, (ii) momentum might be related to underreaction to the
	sentiment information, and (iii) market participants pay attention
	to sentiment score information in analyst news. The findings are
	consistent with a model where one trader has private information
	and others are trading based on past returns and volume information.}},

  title = {GENETAG: a tagged corpus for gene/protein named entity recognition.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6 Suppl 1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step
	for text mining the biomedical literature. Evaluating the performance
	of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test
	corpus. The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER
	is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names.
	We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus
	of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences
	were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition. RESULTS: To ensure
	heterogeneity of the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored
	for term similarity to documents with known gene names and 10K high-
	and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The original
	20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger and the
	results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein
	names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the
	tagged entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in GENETAG
	was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names
	it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints.
	Semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain
	its true meaning in the sentence context. Application of these constraints
	results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an NER
	system than unrestricted partial matching. CONCLUSION: The annotation
	of GENETAG required intricate manual judgments by annotators which
	hindered tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into words,
	to provide indices supporting comparison of system responses to the
	"gold standard". However, character-based indices would have been
	more robust than word-based indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1
	data and ancillary programs are freely available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz.
	A newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this year.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to lay out a methodology and corresponding
	computer algorithms, that allow us to extract the detailed data on
	inventors contained in patents, and harness it for economic research.
	Patent data has long been used in empirical research in economics,
	and yet the information on the identity (i.e. the names and location)
	of the patents' inventors has seldom been deployed in a large scale,
	primarily because of the "who is who" problem: the name of a given
	inventor may be spelled differently across her/his patents, and the
	exact same name may correspond to different inventors (i.e. the "John
	Smith" problem). Given that there are over 2 million patents with
	2 inventors per patent on average, the "who is who" problem applies
	to over 4 million "records", which is obviously too large to tackle
	manually. We have thus developed an elaborate methodology and computerized
	procedure to address this problem in a comprehensive way. The end
	result is a list of 1.6 million unique inventors from all over the
	world, with detailed data on their patenting histories, their employers,
	co-inventors, etc. Forty percent of them have more than one patent,
	and 70,000 have more than 10 patents. We can trace those multiple
	inventors across time and space, and thus study the causes and consequences
	of their mobility across countries, regions, and employers. Given
	the increasing availability of large computerized data sets on individuals,
	there may be plenty of opportunities to deploy this methodology to
	other areas of economic research as well.},

	the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental

	(cDTM). The cDTM is a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian motion
	to model the latent topics through a sequential collection of documents,
	where a ``topic'' is a pattern of word use that we expect to evolve
	over the course of the col- lection. We derive an efficient variational
	approximate inference algorithm that takes advantage of the sparsity
	of observations in text, a property that lets us easily han- dle
	many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time
	dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized. Moreover,
	the complexity of vari- ational inference for the dDTM grows quickly
	as time granularity increases, a drawback which limits fne-grained
	discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting
	both predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.},

  abstract = {{This paper introduces the notion of temporally constrained ranked
	retrieval, which, given a query and a time constraint, produces the
	best possible ranked list within the specified time limit. Naturally,
	more time should translate into bet- ter results, but the ranking
	algorithm should always pro- duce some results. This property is
	desirable from a number of perspectives: to cope with diverse users
	and information needs, as well as to better manage system load and
	variance in query execution times. We propose two temporally con-
	strained ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic prediction
	models that can naturally incorporate efficiency constraints: one
	that makes independent feature selection de- cisions, and the other
	that makes joint feature selection de- cisions. Experiments on three
	different test collections show that both ranking algorithms are
	able to satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model
	outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver more effective
	results, especially under tight time constraints, due to its ability
	to capture feature dependencies.}},

	other share similar value patterns. The first hypothesis is supported:
	indeed, individuals were found to communicate more frequently with

	to which this is true appears to depend at least in part on the value
	patterns themselves. However, the second hypothesis is not supported

	where each topic itself is typically modeled by a unigram word distribution.
	Documents however often have known structures and the same topic
	can exhibit different word distributions under different parts of

	the unigram word distributions with a factored representation conditioned
	on both the topic and the structure. In the resultant model each
	topic is equivalent to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure
	a word is in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the
	corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial explosion
	and leads to efficient parameterization. We derive the variational
	optimization algorithm for the new model. The model shows improved
	perplexity on text and image data, but no significant accuracy improvement

	while also protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms

  abstract = {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet, which is the
	building of a multilingual database with lexical semantic networks
	or wordnets for several European languages. Each wordnet in the database
	represents a language-specific structure due to the unique lexicalization
	of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked via a separate
	Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across languages should
	share the same index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
	database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations and semantic
	structures, revealing answers to fundamental linguistic and philosophical
	questions which could never be answered before. How consistent are
	lexical semantic networks across languages, what are the language-specific
	differences of these networks, is there a language-universal ontology,
	how much information can be shared across languages? First attempts
	to answer these questions are given in the form of a set of shared
	or common Base Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets
	and their classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These
	Base Concepts play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless,
	the database may also serve many practical needs with respect to
	(cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools,
	language generation tools and language learning tools, which are
	discussed in the final chapter. <br/> The book offers an excellent
	introduction to the EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field
	and raises many issues that set the directions for further research
	in semantics and knowledge engineering.}},
